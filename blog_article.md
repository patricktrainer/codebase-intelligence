# Orchestrating Claude Code: Building a Continuous Codebase Analysis System

*How to leverage Claude Code instances at scale to maintain living documentation and automated code intelligence*

---

In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, maintaining up-to-date documentation and code intelligence has become increasingly challenging. Traditional approaches to code analysis and documentation often fall behind the pace of development, leading to outdated docs, knowledge silos, and technical debt accumulation. 

This article explores how to orchestrate multiple instances of Claude Code to create a continuous codebase analysis system that automatically maintains living documentation, tracks architectural changes, and provides ongoing code quality insights.

## The Challenge: Keeping Pace with Code Evolution

Modern codebases change rapidly. Features are added, bugs are fixed, architectures evolve, and technical debt accumulates. Manual documentation updates lag behind these changes, creating several problems:

- **Documentation drift**: READMEs and docs become stale
- **Lost context**: Understanding of design decisions fades over time
- **Hidden dependencies**: Component relationships become unclear
- **Quality regression**: Code quality issues accumulate unnoticed
- **Onboarding friction**: New developers struggle to understand the system

What if instead of manually maintaining documentation, we could orchestrate AI agents to continuously analyze our codebase and maintain living documentation that evolves with our code?

## Solution Architecture: Dagster-Orchestrated Claude Code

The solution involves using [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) as an orchestration engine to coordinate multiple Claude Code instances, each responsible for different aspects of codebase analysis. This creates a robust pipeline that automatically:

1. **Monitors code changes** via Git integration
2. **Assesses impact** of changes on architecture and dependencies
3. **Updates documentation** based on code evolution
4. **Maintains knowledge graphs** of component relationships
5. **Performs quality audits** on a scheduled basis

### Core Components

The system consists of several interconnected Dagster assets:

```python
@asset(description="Detects and analyzes recent code changes")
def code_changes(context, config: RepositoryConfig):
    # Git integration to detect commits
    # Claude Code analysis of each change
    
@asset(ins={"code_changes": AssetIn()})
def impact_assessment(context, code_changes):
    # Aggregate analysis of change impacts
    # Architectural and breaking change detection
    
@asset(ins={"impact_assessment": AssetIn()})
def documentation_updates(context, impact_assessment):
    # Generate/update documentation files
    # Maintain documentation index
```

## Implementation Deep Dive

### 1. Git Change Detection and Analysis

The foundation of the system is continuous monitoring of code changes:

```python
def get_git_commits(repo_path: str, since: datetime, branch: str = "main"):
    """Fetch git commits since the specified date."""
    repo = git.Repo(repo_path)
    commits = []
    
    for commit in repo.iter_commits(branch, since=since):
        # Extract commit metadata and diff
        # Create structured CodeChange objects
```

Each detected commit triggers Claude Code analysis with a specialized prompt:

```python
prompt = f"""
Analyze this git commit and provide a structured analysis:

Commit: {commit.commit_hash}
Message: {commit.message}
Files changed: {', '.join(commit.files_changed)}

Diff preview: {diff_text}

Provide:
1. Type of change (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
2. Key modifications
3. Potential impacts
4. Code quality observations
"""
```

### 2. Impact Assessment Pipeline

Individual commit analyses are aggregated into comprehensive impact assessments:

```python
@asset(ins={"code_changes": AssetIn()})
def impact_assessment(context, code_changes):
    prompt = f"""
    Based on the following code changes, provide comprehensive impact assessment:
    
    Changes: {json.dumps(code_changes, indent=2)}
    
    Assess:
    - architectural_changes: List[str]
    - breaking_changes: List[str] 
    - new_patterns: List[str]
    - performance_implications: List[str]
    - affected_components: List[str]
    - risk_level: str (low, medium, high)
    """
```

This creates structured data that downstream processes can consume to make informed decisions about documentation updates and quality concerns.

### 3. Automated Documentation Generation

Based on impact assessments, Claude Code generates and updates documentation:

```python
@asset(ins={"impact_assessment": AssetIn()})
def documentation_updates(context, impact_assessment):
    prompt = f"""
    Create or update documentation files in ./docs/ based on:
    {json.dumps(impact_assessment, indent=2)}
    
    Focus on:
    1. Architecture changes documentation
    2. Breaking changes and migration guide  
    3. New features and API documentation
    4. Deployment and configuration updates
    """
```

The system maintains a `DocumentationManager` that handles file operations and ensures consistency across documentation formats.

### 4. Knowledge Graph Construction

The system builds and maintains a knowledge graph of codebase relationships:

```python
@asset(ins={"code_changes": AssetIn(), "impact_assessment": AssetIn()})
def codebase_knowledge_graph(context, code_changes, impact_assessment):
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze codebase structure and create knowledge graph files:
    
    1. nodes.json - Components, modules, classes, functions
    2. edges.json - Dependencies and relationships  
    3. metrics.json - Complexity and quality metrics
    4. analysis.md - Human-readable analysis report
    
    Focus on:
    - Module and service relationships
    - Data flow paths
    - Component dependencies
    - Circular dependencies
    - Central points of failure
    """
```

This knowledge graph enables sophisticated queries about system architecture and helps identify potential refactoring opportunities.

### 5. Scheduled Quality Audits

Beyond reactive change analysis, the system performs proactive quality audits:

```python
@asset(
    partitions_def=WeeklyPartitionsDefinition(start_date="2024-01-01"),
    compute_kind="claude_code"
)
def code_quality_audit(context, config):
    prompt = f"""
    Perform comprehensive code quality audit:
    
    Analyze for:
    1. Technical debt accumulation
    2. Inconsistent patterns across modules
    3. Security vulnerability patterns  
    4. Performance bottlenecks
    5. Missing abstractions or over-engineering
    6. Test coverage gaps
    """
```

## Claude Code Integration

The heart of the system is the `ClaudeCodeClient` that manages communication with Claude Code instances:

```python
class ClaudeCodeClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, timeout: int = 600):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.timeout = timeout
        
    async def execute_async(self, prompt: str, context: Dict[str, Any], 
                           workspace_path: Optional[Path] = None):
        cmd = [
            "claude",
            "--model", "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", 
            "--output-format", "json",
            "--dangerously-skip-permissions",
            prompt
        ]
        
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
            *cmd, stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE, stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE
        )
        # Handle JSON streaming output and error cases
```

This client handles:
- **Asynchronous execution** for performance
- **Structured output parsing** from Claude Code's JSON format
- **Error handling and retry logic**
- **Workspace management** for file operations

## Orchestration with Dagster

Dagster provides several key capabilities for this use case:

### Asset Dependencies
```python
# Dependency graph: code_changes → impact_assessment → documentation_updates
# Parallel execution: codebase_knowledge_graph runs independently
```

### Sensors and Scheduling
```python
@sensor(job_name="continuous_analysis")
def commit_sensor(context):
    # Trigger pipeline when new commits detected
    
quality_audit_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    name="weekly_quality_audit",
    cron_schedule="0 0 * * 0",  # Every Sunday
    job_name="quality_audit_job"
)
```

### Configuration Management
```python
class RepositoryConfig(Config):
    repo_path: str = "."
    branch: str = "main" 
    lookback_days: int = 7

class ClaudeCodeConfig(Config):
    api_key: str = os.getenv("CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY", "")
    max_retries: int = 3
    timeout_seconds: int = 300
```

## Operational Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- **Parallel execution**: Multiple Claude Code instances can analyze different aspects simultaneously
- **Incremental processing**: Only analyze changes since last run
- **Caching**: Store and reuse analysis results where appropriate
- **Rate limiting**: Respect Claude Code API limits and implement backoff strategies

### Error Handling and Resilience

- **Graceful degradation**: Continue processing even if some analyses fail
- **Retry logic**: Handle transient failures with exponential backoff  
- **Monitoring**: Track execution success rates and performance metrics
- **Alerting**: Notify on persistent failures or quality degradation

### Security and Compliance

- **Credential management**: Secure handling of API keys and secrets
- **Access controls**: Limit which repositories and files can be analyzed
- **Audit logging**: Track all analysis activities for compliance
- **Privacy**: Handle sensitive code and data appropriately
